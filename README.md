## How It Works

Users interact through a chat interface where they provide their resume and work preferences. The system finds 10 relevant companies and their founder emails, drafts custom short cold emails using proven formats, and sends 5 emails daily on behalf of the user.

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd applyo
   ```

2. Set up the backend:
   ```bash
   cd applyo-worker
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Set up the frontend (in a new terminal):
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   pnpm install
   pnpm dev
   ```

4. Access the application at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
