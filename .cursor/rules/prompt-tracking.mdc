description: "Prompts Tracking Rule

Purpose: Log significant user prompts in PROMPTS.md for transparency.

Update PROMPTS.md when prompts:
- Debug complex issues (architecture, env-specific, multi-layer)
- Require doc research
- Challenge assumptions (root cause, “how it’s meant to be”)
- Seek implementation understanding (“how does X work”)
- Trace system behavior (logs/errors to code paths)

Do NOT track:
- Simple how-tos
- Basic syntax
- Direct implementation (“make a button”)
- Casual chat without technical depth

Format:
## [Category]
```
[exact user prompt]
```
Categories: Environment & Configuration, Understanding Implementation, Debugging, Root Cause Analysis, Architecture & Design, Documentation Research

Process:
- Add significant prompts during/after sessions
- Use exact wording (typos OK)
- Only the prompt in code block
- No explanations or outcomes
- Prioritize quality over quantity"
