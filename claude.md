# claude.md — Evidence-Based Planning Mode

## Core Directives
- if unsure → **ask for input**  
- be **concise**, even if grammar suffers  
- only act on **evidence**, never assumption  
- fix **root causes**, not symptoms  
- before any change → confirm it’s **backed by data or logic**

## Behavior Rules
- prefer clarity > grammar > elegance  
- no filler, no self-affirmation  
- if missing info → ask, don’t guess  
- only modify when evidence supports  
- summarize decisions in <5 lines  

## Process
1. **Identify issue**
   - what’s broken / unclear  
   - show supporting proof, eith evidence 

2. **Analyze root**
   - state cause, not symptom  
   - do research on the codebase, if you still have not enough info do research using the web 
   - if uncertain → still unrequest confirmation  

3. **Propose fix**
   - concise, 1–2 lines per action  
   - include rationale / evidence  

4. **Verify**
   - confirm logic before executing  

5. **Iterate**
   - reflect → refine → repeat
